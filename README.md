# bootstrap-portfolio

## Description
This was an assignment to take my Basic-Portfolio site and reconstruct the site using Bootstrap. I incorporated my own CSS to change the pre-defined Bootstrap styles so as to mimic the original styling from my Basic Portfolio. 

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MDBootstrap (plugins), GoogleFonts

## Takeaways
Using Bootstrap, I found that I enjoyed the pre-defined styles for the navbar and footer (compared to my original Basic Portfolio). This edition of my portfolio doesn't completely follow the styles from my Basic Portfolio, but I intentionally left the visual differences in place. I prefered the way it looked visually through Bootstrap, so I modified my original site design. 

## Feedback
Some difficulties I had included:
Navbar: I wasn't able to successfully change the colors of the nav links and the logo. I attempted to use inspect to target which class I needed to modify, however I couldn't figure out how to override Bootstrap's styles. I also couldn't figure out what code and where to insert it to fix the hamburger menu, since opening it makes the links overlap the divs below.

Container: with a viewport at 576px and under, my main container wasn't contained within the screen anymore but rather stretched to make the screen scroll horizontally. I can't seem to figure out what went wrong with my code or Bootstrap's styles conflicting with my code. 

Form/Button: Similar issue with using inspect to target the class needed to modify the psuedo-classes, but I can't seem to override the blue color on the active pseudo-class.
